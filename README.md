# `<Daily Grind />` ☕

> Premium organic coffee for developers, designers, and builders who ship.

## About

**Daily Grind** is an e-commerce experience built for the modern maker. Think of it as your coffee shop's CI/CD pipeline—meticulously crafted, fully optimized, and always delivering fresh.

We're not just selling coffee. We're shipping excellence, one bag at a time.

- **Add to Cart** - Simple, fast checkout flow (because waiting is for production builds)
- **Responsive Design** - Looks great on everything from mobile to ultrawide monitors
- **Dark Mode Native** - Built for those late-night coding sessions
- **Real-time Updates** - Hot module replacement for your cart (thanks, Vite)

## The Philosophy

Great code requires great coffee. We partner directly with small-scale farmers, roast in small batches, and ship within 48 hours. Every bag is traceable, sustainable, and guaranteed to keep you in flow state.

From bean to bag, every step is optimized for quality. Think of it as our CI/CD pipeline—but for coffee.
