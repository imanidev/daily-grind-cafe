## The Philosophy

Great code requires great coffee. We partner directly with small-scale farmers, roast in small batches, and ship within 48 hours. Every bag is traceable, sustainable, and guaranteed to keep you in flow state.

From bean to bag, every step is optimized for quality. Think of it as our CI/CD pipeline—but for coffee.
